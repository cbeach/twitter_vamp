Copyright Â© 2011 Casey Beach

Developed by Casey Beach to be used as a data collection tool for research 
into nautral language processing, machine learning, and data analysis.

TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Test that database initialization.  Once functioning start collecting data.
* Write database transfer tool.
* Begin iterative optimization of database.
	* Low hanging fruit:
		* Reduce redundency in data: Optimize using lookup tables for text, and
									 common prefix lookups for urls etc.
		
		* Reduce small tables to flat files

		* Column-wise optimization:  Reduce as much data as possible to single
									 columns to reduce database overhead.

*Create IRC bot for control.

Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.01 - collect_data.py will connect with the twitter api useing a hardcoded
user name and password.  The twitter streaming api is dumped straight to the
terminal.  The data base initialization is written but not yet tested in any
way.
